I'm studying Computer Science at UMass Amherst, and I've worked at multiple companies in the industry:
- Amazon Lab 126 (Summer 2021)
- TJX (Summer 2023 && full time starting Fall 2024)
This summer I'll be working with Carolina Crown.
I've also run quite a few websites and game servers over the years, most notably wapchan.org.
