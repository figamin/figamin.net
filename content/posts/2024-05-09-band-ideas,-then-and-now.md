A lot of people wanted or want to start a band at some point in their lives, and I was (and am) no different. Note that this page is discussing being a member of an independent, small band, as opposed to a larger organization (I have years of experience with those but that's for another day). There's just one, tiny problem - for most of my life, I didn't deliberately listen to music much. Let me repeat:<br>
**For most of my life, I didn't deliberately listen to music much.**<br>
This probably seems very strange - that's because it is. It's not that I had some aversion to music outright, since I did school bands for many years and did listen to songs a lot. It's just the delibrate action of loading up Spotify, iTunes or YouTube, pulling up an album, and listening to it the whole way through. That's just not something I did, and it caused me to have a profoundly poor knowledge of music in general. Usually I'd rather watch YouTube videos over and over again or other actions that didn't do me any real good. I had a strong cursoury knowledge from reviews, but not much when it actually came to the songs themselves (this also applied to movies and tv). YouTube really messed me up, but to be fair I did little to combat my addition for a long, long time. I recently set out to listen to an album a day - a bold statement by any measure, but one I feel is necessary given my gaps in knowledge. Anyways, I digress. Let's get back to the topic at hand.<br>
Back in middle school, I had the "bold" idea to put together a group I called the "Garage Orchestra". It's hard to blame 12 year old me though, since putting together rock songs on a bunch of woodwind and brass instruments on paper could be interesting. Unfortunately I lacked any real commitment to actually putting something together, such that in the ultimate example of irony after all my friends came to my folks place with their instruments and we just stood around for a while, we eventually just decided to play Rock Band. It's hard to feel too bad, since that night was fun in of itself.<br>
The next time I was thinking about forming a band was in high school, with my best friend and his girlfriend at the time set to be a part of it, and I really wanted this to be special, so I got my folks to get me a Korg Minilouge. I love the 80s and there's nothing more 80s than a proper analog synth. The problems were twofold though: One was that I actually had to commit to practicing the instrument since I didn't know piano very well, and the other was that this group was far more in my head than it was in actuality. They all wanted to do something more jazz focused where as I wanted to go in a very different direction, and I've always struggled to compromise my vision on creative endeavors like this. I was the one buying most of the equipment for this and it didn't go anywhere in the end, so I was stuck with a bunch of microphones I didn't end up using much.<br>
After that, my ideas have languished. A few years back I came up with a title:<br>
**Indigo Kimono**<br>
I was playing this awful old flash dating sim years ago and saw that line in the dialouge, and it just rolls off the tounge real nice. Coupled with the fact that this eventual group I'd like to form will move in a city pop esque direction, and it only seemed right. But that'll have to sit on the shelf for now. I got other stuff to do, first of all...
