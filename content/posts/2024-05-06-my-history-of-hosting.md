Over the years, I've tried many times to be "successful" in the world of website and game server hosting. Most of these have petered out after some time, but I figure it would be worth reminiscing about...

# FigCraft

My earliest real hosting projects were centered around Minecraft when I was 12. Back then I was just hosting on a 2007 iMac with a GUI port forwarder (think it was "Port Map"?) that evidently suppported UPnP. This project was relaunched multiple times in the next few years, and I know this because I made a point of preserving the maps, which I will share with you all here.
### Note:
The ZIP files contain the world files for each server, which can be put in the "saves" folder for their corresponding Minecraft versions.
2/19/13 - [FigCraft Launch Video, Minecraft version 1.4.6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Vml6W_5ddE)
This is the original launch video made for FigCraft. It probably went up and down over the year before the server was shut down for good seemingly in December. An interesting note is that I was running Nodus when making this video, since this was still during my griefer days.
12/27/13 - [FigCraft 1.0, Minecraft version 1.7.2](https://files.catbox.moe/n9rwfs.zip)
FigCraft (retroactively titled 1.0) was a "network" server, which was pretty ambitous for someone who's 13 and barely knows how to run one server. The servers included
- Lobby
- FFA Survival
- Creative
- No Grief Survival
- Prison
- Factions
