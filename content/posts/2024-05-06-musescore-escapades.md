Since I've learned the F Horn back in fifth grade, I've been interested in sheet music, and in the seventh grade I found that one of my friends had started composing in [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/en), a free and open source scorewriting program. Now at that point in my life, I knew little of songwriting, and even less of music theory, but I found it pretty neat nonetheless. Now I didn't actually do anything with this besides some experiments<br>
